We are going to be consuming another API, which is hosted at Stranger's Things API.

This one is different, in that it allows us to do more than request data... it also allows us to create data! In order to do this we will have to learn about CRUD (an acronym for Create, Read, Update, Destroy), how to improve our fetch game, and about user authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Building and running on localhost

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To run in hot module reloading mode:

```sh
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build-prod
```

To create a development build:

```sh
npm run build-dev
```

## Running

Open the file `dist/index.html` in your browser
